# Note: About the Split Archive

Due to GitHub's file size limit of 100MB per file, the ISO image has been compressed into a multi-part (split) archive.

## How to Extract the Archive

You will need a file archiver that supports split volumes to combine and extract the original file. We recommend using one of the following free applications:

-   [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
-   [PeaZip](https://peazip.github.io/)

**Extraction Steps:**

1.  Download **all** parts of the split archive (e.g., `.zip.001`, `.zip.002`, etc.) and ensure they are all located in the same directory.
2.  **Select all the archive parts**, then right-click on the first volume (the file ending in `.001`) and choose the "Extract" option.
3.  Your archiving tool will automatically detect all subsequent parts and merge them to restore the single, complete ISO file.

## File Integrity Verification

To ensure the file you downloaded is complete, uncorrupted, and authentic, you can verify its SHA-256 checksum against the value below.
